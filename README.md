# Webpack, TypeScript, React, and Jest
This is a simple starter kit for new project.
Made it for myself so there would be no need in CRA.

## Commands
Starting project using Yarn, but you can use npm if you wish.

```bash
yarn - to install dependencies
yarn start - to start the project
yarn test - to run Jest tests
```
## Versions
```bash
React 16.6.0
Typescript 4.1.2
```
## Todo
Make this work with React 17 when Jest adapter will be updated.
